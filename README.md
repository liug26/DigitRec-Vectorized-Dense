# Digit Recognition w/ Dense Layers from Scratch
The contained python files provide a framework to implement a simple neural network that recognizes hand-written digits.
The training data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview

The network that I built has 3 hidden layers each with 96, 80, and 10 neurons. It achieves a roughly 96% training-set accuracy, and a 95% dev-set and test-set accuracy.
